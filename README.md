# Animal and Vehicle Recognition for Autonomous Vehicles

This project develops a deep-learning image classification system designed to help autonomous vehicles recognize the presence of animals and vehicles. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model is trained to distinguish between **animals** and **vehicles**, supporting safer decision-making in self-driving systems.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on accurate visual recognition to detect obstacles and living beings. This notebook explores a complete workflow—from data preparation to model evaluation—to build a reliable classifier using deep learning techniques.

## 📂 Features

* **Dataset loading & preprocessing**
  The dataset is cleaned, resized, normalized, and split into training and testing sets.

* **CNN model development**
  Implementation of a custom convolutional neural network built with standard deep-learning libraries.

* **Training and validation**
  Use of callbacks, augmentation, and regularization to reduce overfitting and improve performance.

* **Performance evaluation**
  Accuracy curves, loss curves, and detailed model predictions are analyzed.
